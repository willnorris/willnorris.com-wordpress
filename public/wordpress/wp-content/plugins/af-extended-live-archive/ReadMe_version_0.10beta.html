    <h1>ReadMe for Extended Live Archive Plugin, version 0.10beta </h1>
    <p>The Extended Live Archive plugin is one selfcontained bundle called af-extended-live-archive, which should be put into the plugin folder to yield the following structure:</p>
    <pre>
	wp-content/
		\_...
		\_ plugins/
	   		\_...
	   		\_ af-extended-live-archive/
	   		    \_ elalicenses.txt
				\_ af-extended-live-archive.php
				\_ af-extended-live-archive-include.php
				\_ af-extended-live-archive-options.php
	   			\_ includes/
					\_ af-extended-live-archive.js
					\_ af-ela.php
					\_ af-ela-style.css
				\_ cache/
				    \_ empty directory used to store the cache files
</pre>
    <p>The plugin provides a single template function called af_ela_super_archive(). It writes some javascript information in the page it's called in and initializes the whole thing. Some parameter can be passed to the template function
    <strong>However, it is STRONGLY recommended that one uses the option panel the plugin is adding to the admin pages to configure ELA. </strong></p>
    <p>Doing so, all one has to do to display the Extended Live Archive is to add a <code>&lt;?php af_ela_super_archive(); ?&gt;</code> call wherever one wants the stuff to show up.</p>
    <p>Note that if you are using K2, beta one r96 or after, the archives page is already doing that for you.</p>
    <p>To install the plugin, 
    <ol>
    	<li>upload the af-extended-archive directory and its content to your wp-content/plugins/ directory. </li>
    	<li>make sure the cache directory permission are set to 0777 (refer to your webhost knowledge-base if need be)</li>
    	<li>Then, visit the option->Ext. Live Archive page once to initialize it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The plugin HomePage can be found somewhere in <a href="http://www.sonsofskadi.net/extended-live-archive/">SonsOfSkadi.net</a> and the support forum is over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ela-support/">Flickr</a>.<p>
