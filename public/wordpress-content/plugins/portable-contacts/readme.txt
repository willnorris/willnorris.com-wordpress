Some kind of Portable Contacts Delegation based on the awesome OpenID/Portable Contacts Demo by JanRain.

== Description ==

Use your Blog to delegate Portable Contact requests to the provider you want (for example Plaxo). The Idea is based on
the [OpenID/Portable Contacts Demo by JanRain](http://portablecontactsdemo.janrain.com/).

This Plugin is based on the [XRDS-Simple Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xrds-simple/), so you have to install this plugin first.

== Installation ==

* Upload the `portable-contacts` folder to your `wp-content/plugins` folder
* Activate it at the admin interface
