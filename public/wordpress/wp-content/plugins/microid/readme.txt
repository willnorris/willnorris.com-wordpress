Add MicroIDs to your blog to enable ownership claims with third-parties.

== Description ==

"MicroID enables anyone to claim verifiable ownership over content hosted
anywhere on the web" ([microid.org][]).  This plugin makes that easier by
generating MicroIDs for you based on an identifier WordPress already has, or by
an additional identifier you provide.

Partially inspired by other MicroID plugins by [Richard Miller][] and [Eran Sandler][].
