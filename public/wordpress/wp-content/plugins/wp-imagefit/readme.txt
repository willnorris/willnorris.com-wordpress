WP-Imagefit is a plugin that extends jQuery to proportionally resize images posts to fit the width of the containing column. 


== Description ==

Rather than relying on a CSS or HTML-driven approach to resize large or wide images, WP-Imagefit relies on Javascript to proportionately resize images based on the width of the containing column.

This plugin is currently compatible with an hAtom-based theme like K2 or Sandbox.
