Jetpack auto-activates new modules, without asking your permission. This plugin stops that.

== Description ==

The [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) plugin by Automattic does something sneaky: it auto-activates new Jetpack modules. Instead of allowing you to opt in to new modules, Jetpack cheerfully activates them without your permission. These modules can change how your site works and looks.

Manual Control puts a stop to that unwanted behavior. It prevents auto-activation of new Jetpack modules.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't you just ask them to stop doing this? =

I did.

= Will this continue to work in the future? =

I can't gurantee it. If they change how Jetpack module auto-activation and error handling works, it could break.
