## Unstable Repo Warning ##

I tend to overwrite commits, perform force pushes, and occasionally rewrite
the entire history of the repository (normally to remove certain files to try
and reduce the overall size of the repository).  Don't rely on anything here.


## License ##

There is very little original content in this repository. The vast majority of
the code is pulled in via git submodules, and those projects have their own
licenses.  What little code there is here (for example, a few files in
[mu-plugins](public/content/mu-plugins)) is free to use under an [MIT
License](https://willnorris.com/licenses/mit).
