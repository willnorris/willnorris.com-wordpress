	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<div id="our-story">

<p class="will">I guess our story starts in 2001 while I was at college in 
Atlanta, GA.  I was studying computer science and had been a pretty big fan of 
the rock band Skillet for about a year, so I decided to setup a website about 
the band.  The site quickly grew and evolved into a decent size community of 
Skillet fans.</p>

<p class="elisabeth">I was here in Southern California, and had been introduced 
to Skillet that same year by my best friend.  I was aware of the community Will 
had setup, but didn't really like a lot of the people there.  So I got involved 
with, and later managed, a different Skillet community.  Of course Will and I 
knew who each other were and he helped me on a few technical things, but 
otherwise we kept to ourselves.  Honestly, he tended to come off as a bit of an 
elitist snob.</p>

<p class="will">Yeah? Well you seemed to be running a preschool with little 
kids just running amuck!</p>

<p class="elisabeth">Anyway, needless to say we didn't exactly get along.  We 
had two very different communities that attracted very different types of 
people, and we generally left it at that.</p>

<p class="will">Now by the summer of 2002, I had moved back home to Memphis, 
Tennessee.  I wasn't working that summer so a few friends from the Skillet 
community and I decided to take a road trip to California.  Skillet was playing 
several shows over a couple of days, so we arranged for a dozen or so of us 
that knew each other online to all meet up at the shows.  There's several folks 
missing from this picture, but you can see Elisabeth and I kneeling down in 
front <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p class="elisabeth">Those concerts that summer changed a lot for me.  Will was 
always a bit intimidating to a lot of people, because he ran the big community 
and knew the band pretty well and all.  I didn't really know what to expect 
when I met him, but I was pretty much ready to not like him much.  What I saw 
though was this skinny guy with firey red hair and moccasins... and he was 
actually kinda cute.  Without realizing it, I basically fell in love with my 
arch-enemy.</p>

<p class="elisabeth">But then of course he went back home to Memphis.  I tried 
to pursue him a bit, but he wouldn't give me the time of day.</p>

<p class="will">What?  When did you pursue me?  The fact of the matter is, I 
thought she was pretty cute.  I mean really, did you see that picture up there?  
But I was also realistic... we lived almost 2000 miles apart, hardly knew each 
other, and weren't really in the position to get into a long distance 
relationship.  She was a beautiful girl, but that was it.</p>

<p class="elisabeth">About a year later in 2003, the two communities that we 
were managing merged into one.  Will and I worked together a bit to pull that 
off and then co-managed the new community for a while.  By this time though, I 
had begun working with a different band and ultimately left the Skillet 
community to go work with them, leaving things to Will.  Except for a couple of 
short emails, we didn't really talk much for the next 2 or 3 years... we had 
gone our separate ways.</p>

<p class="will">During those next few years I had been going to school and 
working at the University of Memphis.  I was working on a pretty cool project 
called Shibboleth that was used by a lot universities around the world.  In 
October 2005, I heard that a school in California was looking for a Shibboleth 
administrator, so I expressed my interest in the position.  My job at UofM was 
only a part-time position and I had no real ties to Memphis, so I figured I had 
nothing to lose.</p>

<p class="will">I got in touch with a couple of friends I had in California 
just to let them know I was looking at a job out there.  I remembered that 
Elisabeth was in school, so I contact her to find out where and to see what she 
had been up to the last couple of years.</p>

<p>... still writing the rest. :-\</p>
