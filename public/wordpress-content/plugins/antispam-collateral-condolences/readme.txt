Notifies people when their comment is moderated or caught as spam, so they aren't left wondering.

== Description ==

This plugin notifies people when the comment they just left is moderated or marked as spam. The method of notification can be either a Javascript popup, or an HTML notification in the comment area. You can choose whether spam comments, moderated comments, or both will result in the notification. This is especially useful for spam comments, as the human author will know to contact you and have you rescue the comment from the spam bin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `antispam-collateral-condolences` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
