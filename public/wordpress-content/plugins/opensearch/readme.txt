Add OpenSearch discovery and querying to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Add OpenSearch discovery and querying to your WordPress site, based on the
[OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/Home) specification, version 1.1.

After activating the plugin, your WordPress site will expose a standardised
search interface, accessible to OpenSearch clients such as the [Firefox
search bar](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/search.html).
